## Microservices

The API is built using a microservice architecture, with the following services:

### api-gateway
The `api-gateway` service provides a single entry point for clients to access the various services in the system.

### catalog-service
The `catalog-service` service manages the catalog of products available for sale.

### config-service
The `config-service` service stores configuration data for the various services in the system.

### order-service
The `order-service` service manages orders placed by customers.

### auth-service
The `auth-service` service provides authentication and authorization for the system.

### image-service
The `image-service` service manages the images associated with products.

### customer-service
The `customer-service` service manages information about customers who have registered with the system.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to build this API:

- Spring Cloud (Config, OpenFeign, Eureka)
- JPA / Hibernate
- Springdocv2
- Java version 19
- Spring Boot version 3.0.2
- PostgreSQL database

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install PostgreSQL database and create a database for the application.
3. Update the `application-{service}.yml` file in the `config-server` module with the database details for each service.
4. Start the Eureka server by running the `DiscoveryServerApplication.java` file in the `discovery-server` module.
5. Start the Config Server by running the `ConfigServerApplication.java` file in the `config-server` module.
6. Start the Api Gateway by running the `ApiGatewayApplication.java` file in the `api-gateway` module.
7. Start the remaining modules (catalog-service, order-service, auth-service, image-service, and customer-service) by running their respective `Application.java` files.

## Authentication and Authorization

The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization. When a user logs in, they receive a JWT that must be included in the header of all subsequent requests. The JWT is verified on the server side to ensure that the user is authenticated and authorized to perform the requested action.

## Future Development

In the future, a React-based frontend will be added to the application to provide a user interface for managing products, orders, and customers.

Additionally, the API could be expanded to include features such as payment processing, order tracking, and inventory management. The API could also be optimized for performance by implementing caching, load balancing, and other techniques. Finally, the API could be secured further by adding additional security measures such as rate limiting, input validation, and intrusion detection.
